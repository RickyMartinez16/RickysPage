        <h3>About Ricky</h3>
          <p>After graduating Rutgers University in 2010 I move to the Big Apple and studied acting!  It was there when I found out I didn't have a passion for bussing tables and decided to get into Software Development! </p>

          <p>Normally I would spend my time going to the beach or hosting a fantasy football podcast with my friend but I thought it was time to take my interest in Software Development a bit more serious. </p>

          <p>I joined the Thinkful family and began my path to becoming a full time developer! </p>

          <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer that eager and ready to learn please reach out! I'm excited to work with other like minded and passionate developers! </p>
